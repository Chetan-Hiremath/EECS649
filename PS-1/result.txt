Here is the result of this Python Code. The first line of the result is the actual data of the first set of the last 10 transitions, the second line is the predicted data that is generated by the code, and the third line is the number of wrong guesses when the program has compared the actual data and the predicted data of the first set. If the actual data's state and the predicted data's state are different, then the difference is considered as a wrong guess that will be recorded. The other 3 lines follow the same procedure when the second set is used. If you use this code to generate other results, then the results will be completely random and different due to the random library of the Python Code. But the results will properly count the respective numbers of wrong guesses by any input pairs.
